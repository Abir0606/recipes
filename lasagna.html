            How to cook Lasagna
        </h3>
        <p> The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>
        
        <h3> How to Store and Reheat Leftovers </h3>
            <p>
                Leftover lasagna can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. It can also be frozen for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw the lasagna in the refrigerator overnight and then bake, covered with foil, at 350 degrees F until warmed through, about 45 minutes. You can also reheat individual portions in the microwave.
